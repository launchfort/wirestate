- [ ] Make it so that the file exstension is always expected
      to be `.wirestate` and nothing else. This will simplify
      the codebase and make the docuemtation easier to write.

- [ ] Rewrite GUIDE.md so that it shows a typical usage of
      the `xstate` generator. This needs to be a full example
      that includes running in the browser.

- [ ] Rewrite WIRESTATE-SYNTAX.md to reflect the new syntax.

- [ ] Simplify API.md so that it only talks about the `xstate`
      generator API.
